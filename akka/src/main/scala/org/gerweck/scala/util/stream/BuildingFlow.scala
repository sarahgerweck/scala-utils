/** A [[akka.stream.scaladsl.Flow]] that has a piece of state that it either updates or emits and
  * replaces.
  *
  * A common pattern in stream processing is that you need to collect data that spans across
  * several input elements if they share some key, or you output your state and start over when
  * you get a new key. '''In this model, you never have more than one piece of state at a time.'''
  *
  * A simple example of this is run length encoder, where your input is a stream of `Symbol`,
  * and your output is a stream of `(Symbol, Int)` pairs that represent how many times you saw
  * that symbol. At each point in time, you're going to keep a `(Symbol, Int)` pair, emitting the
  * pending pair if you get a new symbol or the stream ends.
  *
  * This can be implemented like this:
  *
  * {{{
  * class RleFlow[A] extends BuildingFlow[A, (A, Int)] {
  *   protected[this] override def absorb(a: A) = (A, 1)
  *   protected[this] override def combine(state: (A, Int), a: A) = {
  *     if (a == state._1) {
  *       // We have the same symbol, so increment our counter and keep our state
  *       CanCombine((a, state._2 + 1))
  *     } else {
  *       // This is a new symbol, so emit our existing state and absorb this element
  *       NoCombine
  *     }
  *   }
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * See that there are two methods that you must override:
  *
  *  - [[BuildingFlow.absorb]] uses a single element to seed the state when there is no existing
  *    state available.
  *  - [[BuildingFlow.combine]] uses the current state plus a new element and decides whether that
  *    element can be added to the current state.
  *
  * Note that it's not trivial to implement this using built-in `Flow` combinators, because you
  * need to emit any pending state when the stream ends. It's possible to do this by concatenating
  * a special symbol that you use when the stream ends, but this complicates the code and often
  * necessitates a wrapper.
  *
  * This stage does not provide a mechanism to transform the state for output, as this can be
  * trivially accomplished by calling `.map(â€¦)` on your `BuildingFlow`.
  *
  * @tparam A the type of object that flows into this graph stage
  * @tparam B the state representation that the stage builds and the output of the flow stage. It
  * is permissible for this state to be mutable provided that you follow the rules described in [[BuildingFlow.combine]].

  /** Combine the incoming element into the state, or indicate that you should emit the current
    * state and start a new state using [[absorb]].
    *
    * This method must produce a [[BuildingFlow.CombineResult]] through one of two mechanisms:
    *  - Call [[CanCombine]] with the updated state if the incoming element can be added into the
    *    current state.
    *    - In this case, no element will be emitted.
    *  - Use [[NoCombine]] if the incoming element cannot be added into the current state.
    *    - In this case, the current state will be emitted and then [[absorb]] will be called to
    *      seed the new state with the incoming element.
    *    - If you have need to both update the state and emit an element, `BuildingFlow` is not
    *      suitable for your use case.
    *
    * @note it is safe to mutate the `state` object ''if and only if'' you return a `CanCombine`.
    * You may not mutate the state at output time. (If you are using mutability for performance
    * reasons while building the state, you may wish to add a stage after this one that eliminates
    * mutable access. This can be accomplished by simply calling `.map` on the `BuildingFlow` and
    * transforming the output into an immutable object.)
